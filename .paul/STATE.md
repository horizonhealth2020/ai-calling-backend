## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
- 2026-04-14: Attribution model EXTENDED in Phase 69 — assignee-credit preserved; resolver-credit added alongside via assistSaves column
- 2026-04-14: assistSaves follows OUTCOME cutoff (pre-v2.9 cross-rep SAVED records count as assist)
- 2026-04-14: Bypass overrides credited to resolver (whoever clicked override), not assignee
- 2026-04-14: "(unresolved)" bypass bucket surfaces data-integrity signal, not silently handled
- 2026-04-14: Sort tiebreaker updated — saveRate desc, (saved + assistSaves) desc, assigned desc
- 2026-04-14: Assignee-credit attribution locked (not resolver-credit) — accountability belongs to assigned rep
- 2026-04-14: 366-day max range cap on /cs/analytics/outreach — prevents unbounded scans
- 2026-04-14: V29_CUTOFF split — pre-v2.9 records excluded from attempt metrics, included in outcome metrics
- 2026-04-14: Unknown assignees surface under "(unassigned/unknown)" row — never silently dropped
- 2026-04-14: Safe-default error contract for analytics — empty arrays/zero counts on sub-query failure, never null
- 2026-04-13: Pre-v2.9 records excluded from stale (requires ≥1 contact attempt)
- 2026-04-13: My Queue for CUSTOMER_SERVICE only (not owner/admin)
- 2026-04-13: CB staleness resets on attempt; PT staleness only clears on resolution
- 2026-04-13: UTC midnight baseline for 48-hour stale deadline
- 2026-04-13: Gate override always visible when < 3 calls
- 2026-04-13: bypassReason persisted on record for CS analytics drill-down

### Deferred Issues
- All v2.8 deferred items closed in Phase 70 (2026-04-14): auditQueue test expectations aligned with shipped service behavior (31/31 passing); clawback cleanup dry-run against production found 0 orphans (DB already clean, no --execute needed); audit-log backfill script archived to prisma/scripts/archive/ as not needed (production feed organically populated in ~2 weeks).
