# High-Severity Fixes Applied

Date: 2026-02-05

## Overview

Three critical issues from [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) have been fixed:

1. ✅ Race condition in queue processor
2. ✅ Memory leak in `morganQueuedIds` Set
3. ✅ Single-lead-per-tick bottleneck

---

## Fix #1: Race Condition Eliminated

### Problem
The `isLaunchingCall` flag was used to prevent concurrent tick execution, but it had a race condition:

```javascript
if (isLaunchingCall) return;  // Check
// ... gap ...
isLaunchingCall = true;       // Set
```

Multiple ticks could pass the check before any set the flag, causing race conditions.

### Solution
**Removed the global lock entirely** and restructured the queue processor:

- ❌ Removed: `isLaunchingCall` flag
- ✅ Added: Per-slot async processing with `Promise.allSettled()`
- ✅ Added: `launchCallForSlot()` helper function for isolated call launching

**Benefits:**
- No race conditions - each slot is handled independently
- Better concurrency - multiple slots can launch calls simultaneously
- Cleaner code - each call launch is isolated and testable

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```javascript
if (isLaunchingCall) return;
const lead = await getNextMorganLead();
isLaunchingCall = true;
try {
  // launch one call
} finally {
  isLaunchingCall = false;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const callPromises = [];
for (const freeSlotId of freeSlots) {
  const lead = await getNextMorganLead();
  callPromises.push(launchCallForSlot(freeSlotId, lead));
}
await Promise.allSettled(callPromises);
```

## Fix #2: Memory Leak Prevention

### Problem
`morganQueuedIds` Set grew indefinitely with no upper bound. Over weeks/months of operation, this would consume increasing memory.

### Solution
Implemented **LRU-style cleanup** with bounded size:

1. **Added constants:**
   - `MAX_QUEUED_IDS = 10,000` - Maximum Set size
   - `morganQueuedIdsTimestamps` - Map to track when each ID was added

2. **Added cleanup function:**
   - `cleanupOldQueuedIds()` - Removes oldest 10% of IDs when limit reached
   - Only removes IDs not currently in the active queue
   - Cleans both the Set and the timestamp Map

3. **Integrated cleanup:**
   - Called automatically in `enqueueMorganLead()` when approaching limit
   - Clears timestamps on dequeue, hydration, and merge

### Code Changes

**New global state:**
```javascript
const MAX_QUEUED_IDS = 10000;
const morganQueuedIdsTimestamps = new Map();
```

**Cleanup logic:**
```javascript
function cleanupOldQueuedIds() {
  const entriesToRemove = Math.floor(MAX_QUEUED_IDS * 0.1);
  const sorted = Array.from(morganQueuedIdsTimestamps.entries())
    .sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

  let removed = 0;
  for (const [leadId] of sorted) {
    if (removed >= entriesToRemove) break;
    const inQueue = morganQueue.some(lead => lead.id === leadId);
    if (!inQueue) {
      morganQueuedIds.delete(leadId);
      morganQueuedIdsTimestamps.delete(leadId);
      removed++;
    }
  }
  logger.info(`[MorganQueue] Cleaned up ${removed} old queued IDs`);
}
```

**Modified functions:**
- `enqueueMorganLead()` - Calls cleanup if needed, tracks timestamps
- `getNextMorganLead()` - Deletes timestamps on dequeue
- `hydrateMorganQueueFromConvoso()` - Clears timestamps on hydration
- `mergeMorganQueueFromMQ()` - Tracks timestamps for new leads

**Benefits:**
- Bounded memory usage (max ~10k entries in Set)
- Automatic cleanup of old entries
- Preserves active queue entries (never removes in-flight leads)
- Logged cleanup for monitoring

## Fix #3: Single-Lead-Per-Tick Bottleneck

### Problem
The queue processor only launched **one call per tick**, even when multiple slots were free:

```javascript
const freeSlots = getFreeMorganSlots();  // e.g., [slot-1, slot-2, slot-3]
const lead = await getNextMorganLead();  // Only processes ONE lead
```

With 3 slots and a 2-second tick interval, maximum throughput was **30 calls/minute** instead of **90 calls/minute**.

### Solution
**Process all free slots in parallel:**

1. Loop through all free slots
2. Dequeue one lead per slot
3. Launch all calls concurrently using `Promise.allSettled()`
4. Log aggregated results

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```javascript
const freeSlots = getFreeMorganSlots();
const lead = await getNextMorganLead();
// Only uses freeSlots[0]
```

**After:**
```javascript
const freeSlots = getFreeMorganSlots();
const callPromises = [];

for (const freeSlotId of freeSlots) {
  if (morganQueue.length === 0) break;

  const lead = await getNextMorganLead();
  if (!lead || !lead.phone) continue;

  callPromises.push(launchCallForSlot(freeSlotId, lead));
}

await Promise.allSettled(callPromises);
```

**Benefits:**
- **3x throughput** - All slots utilized simultaneously
- Graceful handling of empty queue (breaks loop)
- Better error isolation - one failed call doesn't block others
- Clearer logging - shows total calls launched per tick

## Testing

Added comprehensive test suite in [__tests__/queueProcessor.test.js](__tests__/queueProcessor.test.js):

### Test Coverage

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**
   - ✅ Enforces MAX_QUEUED_IDS limit
   - ✅ Cleanup doesn't remove active queue IDs
   - ✅ LRU eviction of oldest entries

2. **Concurrent Call Processing**
   - ✅ Processes multiple leads when slots are free
   - ✅ Handles partial failures gracefully
   - ✅ Stops when queue is empty

3. **Race Condition Elimination**
   - ✅ Allows concurrent tick execution
   - ✅ Promise.allSettled handles failures correctly

4. **Timestamp Tracking**
   - ✅ Tracks timestamps for cleanup
   - ✅ Cleans up timestamps on dequeue

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test queueProcessor.test.js
```

## Performance Impact

### Throughput Improvement

**Before:**
- Max 1 call per 2-second tick
- Max throughput: 30 calls/minute

**After:**
- Max 3 calls per 2-second tick
- Max throughput: 90 calls/minute
- **3x improvement** 🚀

### Memory Impact

**Before:**
- Unbounded `morganQueuedIds` Set
- Potential for multi-MB growth over time

**After:**
- Bounded to ~10k entries
- Additional ~10k entries in timestamp Map
- Approximately **320 KB max** (10k × 32 bytes per entry × 2 structures)
- Acceptable overhead for production

---

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - API and behavior remain the same for external callers.

### Configuration
No new environment variables required.

### Monitoring

Watch for new log messages:
```
[MorganQueue] Cleaned up N old queued IDs to prevent memory leak
```

If you see this frequently (multiple times per day), consider:
1. Investigating why so many unique leads are being queued
2. Increasing `MAX_QUEUED_IDS` if needed
3. Reviewing lead filtering logic
